    <h1>Office Security Tips</h1>
    <p>
        <img src="/images/security.jpg" alt="Security" class="img-responsive pull-right pageImage">Be sure that your company has a clear set of procedures for dealing with office intruders.&nbsp; By acting quickly, you can keep a bad situation from becoming worse.</p>
    <p>Early morning hours and early evening hours are the most commonly used times for entry by intruders.&nbsp; Be sure your space is secure when staffing is low.</p>
    <p>Do not leave your valuables unattended.&nbsp; Secure all valuables (purses, wallets, backpacks, etc.) in a locked drawer or cabinet when leaving your work space, or out of sight in the trunk when leaving your vehicle.&nbsp; Carry only what you need.&nbsp; Leave occasionally used credit cards, etc., in a secure place at home.</p>
    <p>Record serial numbers of all valuable office items and equipment.&nbsp; If anything is stolen or missing, a record of serial numbers will aid in the recovery of the items.</p>
    <p>Doors should be locked when your area is unoccupied.&nbsp; If your suite has more than one entrance, only one door should be used by everyone to enter and exit with the other access doors locked at all times.&nbsp; This will eliminate doors being propped open or intruders entering undetected.</p>
    <p>Guests and clients should not be allowed past the reception area without an escort or notice to coworkers by phone or intercom.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        If you encounter an unfamiliar and/or unescorted person in the office area, ask, "May I help you?" and accompany the person to his/her destination.&nbsp; An intruder will give you a quick answer and try to walk away.</p>
    <p>Do not try to restrain an intruder.&nbsp; Write down a description of the suspect, last known direction of travel and follow your office procedures.&nbsp; Notify Security immediately by calling 206-224-1203.</p>
    <p>If a theft occurs, report it to the police at 206-625-5011 immediately and then to Security.</p>
    <p>Notify Property Management at 206-224-1201 if you see loiterers, peddlers or canvassers on the premises.</p>
    <p>Call 206-625-5011 for any incident which you believe should be reported to the Police Department but does not require an officer to respond to the scene.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Call <strong>911</strong> for all medical, fire and police emergencies any time you believe police, fire or medical personnel should be sent to the scene.&nbsp; Contact Security at 206-224-1203 so emergency personnel can be directed to the correct elevator and suite.</p>
