    <p><em><strong>Procedures for a partial building evacuation:</strong></em></p>
    <p>Most evacuations happen after activation of the fire alarm system.&nbsp;If you hear the fire alarm on your floor and you have not been advised that it is a test, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Close your office door behind you, but do not lock it.</li>

        <li>Walk down four (4) floors and enter that floor.&nbsp;During a partial building evacuation, the “Safe Refuge Area” is in the building elevator lobby on the receiving floor, located four (4) floors down from the fire floor.</li>
        <li>Wait in the elevator lobby on the receiving floor until an announcement is made that it is safe to return to your floor.&nbsp;Be respectful of the Tenants residing on the receiving floor.</li>
        <li>Follow your company’s protocol for roll call, etc., before returning to your floor.</li>
    </ol>
