    <h1>Fire</h1>
    <p>Make sure Tenant employees know what to do if a fire breaks out on your floor.&nbsp;Everyone should know where the fire extinguishers are located on the floor.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Procedures to follow if there is a fire:</strong></em></p>
    <p><strong>On the Fire Floor:</strong></p>
    <p>Although the building systems will detect a fire and activate the alarm, if you discover a fire, first call <strong>911</strong>, then Security at 206-224-1203.&nbsp;If the fire is small enough and you have been trained, extinguish the fire with a fire extinguisher.</p>
    <p>Trained Floor Wardens will provide direction in the event of a fire or emergency and oversee the safe evacuation of personnel into stairwells.</p>
    <p>Special assistants immediately contact and help their assigned disabled person.</p>
    <p>Floor Wardens will check offices, restrooms and conference rooms after evacuation to ensure no one is left behind. All doors should be closed but not locked.</p>
    <p>When all emergency assigned duties have been completed, Floor Wardens will proceed down four (4) floors or as directed by the Seattle Fire Department or Property Management.</p>
    <p>Floor Wardens will provide necessary assistance during the evacuation.&nbsp;If needed, the intercom in the stairwell can be used and Property Management or Seattle Fire Department personnel will assist you.</p>
    <p><strong>On the Receiving Floor and “Safe Refuge Area”:</strong></p>
    <p>During a partial building evacuation, the "Safe Refuge Area" is in the building elevator lobby on the receiving floor, located four (4) floors down from the fire floor.</p>
    <p>Evacuated personnel should wait in the “Safe Refuge Area” on the receiving floor until an announcement is made to return to your floor.</p>
    <p>Follow your company's procedure for roll call, etc. before returning to your floor.</p>
    <p>All Tenants should familiarize themselves with guidelines recommended by the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/fire/" target="_blank" title="Seattle Fire Department">Seattle Fire Department</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Property Management will:</strong></p>
    <p>Investigate the alarm location prior to arrival of the Seattle Fire Department.</p>
    <p>Escort the Seattle Fire Department to the alarm location and assist in the investigation.</p>
    <p>In the event of an actual fire, the Seattle Fire Department will assume control of the incident and direct Tenants and Property Management accordingly.</p>
    <p>Reset the fire alarm system and make a building-wide announcement after the "All Clear" has been given by the Seattle Fire Department.</p>
