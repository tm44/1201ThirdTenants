    <h1>Power Outage</h1>
    <p>Both Property Management and Tenants have roles and responsibilities during a power outage.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Procedures to follow in a power outage:</strong></em></p>
    <p>Remain calm and in place.&nbsp;If possible, call Security at 206-224-1203 and tell them the specific problem, i.e. loss of outlet power, no lights, etc.</p>
    <p>If you experience a total power failure, turn on a battery-operated radio to find out what is happening in your area.&nbsp;Listen for an announcement from Property Management.</p>
    <p>In the event the building sustains a power failure, emergency lighting is available in the stairwells and common area hallways.</p>
    <p>Unplug all electrical equipment and turn off light switches.&nbsp;When power returns it may surge and damage equipment that was left on prior to the outage.</p>
    <p>If evacuation is necessary, evacuate to your designated area as described in the Building Evacuation procedures (four (4) floors down).</p>
    <p>If it is necessary to close the building, watch your local news or contact Property Management at 206-224-1201 to find out when the building will re-open again.</p>
    <p><strong>Property Management will:</strong></p>
    <p>Make a building-wide announcement to provide further instructions.</p>
    <p>Assist the Seattle Fire and Police Departments in their emergency response.</p>
    <p>Evacuate and close the building until power is restored, if it is known the power outage will continue for an extended period of time.</p>
