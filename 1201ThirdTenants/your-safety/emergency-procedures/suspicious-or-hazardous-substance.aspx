    <h1>Suspicious or Hazardous Substance</h1>
    <p>Know how to respond to encounters with a potential dangerous substance.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Procedures for dealing with a suspicious or hazardous substance:</strong></em></p>
    <p>Remain calm and in place.</p>
    <p>Call <strong>911</strong>, followed by Security at 206-224-1203.&nbsp;It is important that the phone call come from the affected floor so the Seattle Fire and Police Departments will know exactly which floor the call came from.</p>
    <p>A point person on the floor should be identified to speak with the Seattle Fire and Police personnel. They will want to talk with that person on the phone before going to the floor.</p>
    <p>If possible, isolate the substance by closing a door, or if in an open area, putting an empty trash can or other container over it.</p>
    <p>Anyone in contact with the substance should wash their hands with soap.</p>
    <p>Those in contact with, or in the immediate area of the substance, should isolate themselves from everyone else on the floor to prevent cross-contamination.</p>
    <p>Make a list of every person in or near the location of the substance.</p>
    <p>Do not allow anyone to exit or enter the floor via the elevators or stairwells. It is important to know who may have been exposed, to not have others exposed, and to be sure that if anyone needs treatment they are readily identifiable.</p>
