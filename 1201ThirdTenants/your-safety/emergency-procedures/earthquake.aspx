    <h1>Earthquake</h1>
    <p>Standard procedures and description protocols for the office and building if an earthquake occurs.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Procedures for an earthquake:</strong></em></p>
    <p><strong>DO NOT try to exit the building.</strong><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>Find a protected location.</strong><br>
        Get under a table or desk, holding onto one of the legs, crouch against an inside corridor or hall, in a corner away from an outside wall, or near a pillar or support system.&nbsp; The elevator lobby is a good place to be.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>Stay away from windows and glass.</strong><br>
        If being near glass is unavoidable, turn your face away.&nbsp; Grab anything handy, such as a coat, cushion, pillow, blanket, newspapers or even a cardboard box, to shield your head and face from falling debris and splintering glass.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>Beware of falling objects and debris.</strong><br>
        Watch out for falling ceiling tiles, plaster and heavy objects which might fall or slide across the floor.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>Prepare for shaking and swaying.</strong><br>
        If you are on one of the top floors, be prepared for possible swaying of the building.&nbsp; Most of the severe shaking will occur on the lower floors.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>Be calm and wait for instructions.</strong><br>
        Stay in the building on the same floor and wait in the elevator lobby.&nbsp; Wait for instructions telling you how and where to make a safe exit.&nbsp; Don't be surprised if the electricity goes out or if the sprinkler system or fire alarms go on.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>DO NOT use the elevators.</strong><br>
        Even if the power is on, elevators could still be unsafe due to a warp in the shaft which could cause the elevator to stall and you would then be stuck between floors, or the elevator could stop on a floor which is engulfed in flames.&nbsp; During an earthquake, automatic safety devices will stop the elevator in case of a power failure.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>DO NOT use the stairwells.</strong><br>
        Unless you are certain that there is an exit and that the stairwells are lighted, stairwells should be avoided.&nbsp; There could be a blockage below, cutting off the exit to the outside, or an aftershock could jam the doors trapping you between floors.&nbsp; Stairwells are also where people rush to in a time of panic and you could be caught in a mob situation.&nbsp; We utilize a security system which prevents doors from being opened from inside the stairwell, increasing the possibility of becoming trapped.&nbsp; Emergency lighting in stairwells might fail in an earthquake, leaving them dark and hazardous.&nbsp; They may be filled with smoke or hazardous fumes.&nbsp; Wait for instructions telling you how and where to make a safe exit.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>DO NOT rush outside.</strong><br>
        Even if you are on a ground floor, wait for instructions from Property Management.&nbsp; If you feel you must exit the building, wait until the shaking stops, choose an exit carefully and then proceed with caution.&nbsp; Calmly walk out of the building to a safe area outside, away from buildings and overhead wires.&nbsp;</p>
