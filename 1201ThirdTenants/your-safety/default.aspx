    <h1>Your Safety</h1>

        <img src="/images/your_safety.jpg" alt="Your Safety" class="img-responsive pull-right pageImage">It is the intent of Wright Runstad &amp; Company to provide safe and healthful working conditions for our Tenants.&nbsp; Safety is no accident.&nbsp; Each employee is expected to promote and follow safe work practices.</p>
    <p>The Property Management - Tenant relationship is one of mutual dependence and responsibility.&nbsp; This relationship is most important when discussing fire and safety related issues.&nbsp; Tenants depend on Property Management to provide information and instructions on how to respond during an emergency.&nbsp; Similarly, Property Management depends on Tenants to become familiar with this information and participate in evacuation drills and training sessions.</p>
    <h2>Safety Planning</h2>
    <p>Every company needs an emergency response plan to help protect the safety of employees as well as ensure continuity of business operations.&nbsp; We used the FEMA/American Red Cross free publication <em><strong>"Emergency Management Guide for Business &amp; Industry"</strong></em> to provide the following outline for establishing a Safety Plan for your company.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 1: Establish a Planning Team</strong></p>
    <p>Determine who will lead the planning process and who will develop each aspect of the emergency response plan.&nbsp; Set calendar dates for each step of the process to keep the planning on track.&nbsp; Establish a budget for all expenses.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 2: Analyze Capabilities and Hazards</strong></p>
    <p>Review existing internal plans and policies.&nbsp; Meet with outside groups (including Property Management) to determine what resources will be available in an emergency.&nbsp; Identify codes and regulations.&nbsp; Identify critical products, services and operations.&nbsp; Identify internal resources and capabilities.&nbsp; Identify external resources.&nbsp; Do an insurance review.&nbsp; List potential emergencies and assess their impact on people, property and business operations.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 3: Develop the Plan</strong></p>
    <p>Prepare an Executive Summary for top management.&nbsp; Write out all emergency response procedures as simply and briefly as possible.&nbsp; Establish a training schedule for all employees.&nbsp; Distribute the plan to all appropriate internal and external resources.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: Implement the Plan</strong></p>
    <p>Integrate the plan into company operations.&nbsp; Perform drills and exercises to test the plan; don't wait until an actual emergency to find out your plan has flaws.&nbsp; Incorporate emergency response training into new employee orientation.&nbsp; Evaluate and modify the plan annually.</p>
