    <h1>Floor Wardens</h1>
    <p>
        <img src="/images/your_safety.jpg" alt="Your Safety" class="img-responsive pull-right pageImage">Floor Wardens serve as the contact point between the Property Management office and Tenant employees.&nbsp; Floor Wardens ensure that every employee is aware of all emergency procedures and plans, and coordinate Tenant response in an emergency.
    </p>
    <h2>Floor Warden Role</h2>
    <p>
        Be a visible leader in your company and on your floor.&nbsp; Share information, encourage advanced planning and act as the calming force in any building emergency.&nbsp; See our example of a <a href="/media/14610/sample_floor_warden_introduction_letter.pdf" target="_blank" title="Floor Warden Letter">Floor Warden Letter</a> to distribute to all employees on your floor.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Maintain a current roster of all physically disabled persons on your assigned floor and assign at least two Special Assistants per physically disabled person.&nbsp; Provide this information to Property Management and update routinely.&nbsp; Ensure that each Special Assistant for physically disabled persons knows his/her role in an evacuation or emergency.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Know emergency exit routes, stairwell locations and where the stairwells exit onto the street.&nbsp; Take a walk down both stairwells to become familiar with the evacuation experience and stairwell exit locations.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Know where emergency intercoms are located and how to use them.&nbsp; Intercoms are in the stairwells on every fifth floor starting with Floor 5.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Report any potential fire hazards to Property Management through your Office Manager or Corporate Facilities Manager.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Be familiar with your company's own emergency response and security procedures, along with those for the building.&nbsp; Also be sure to have additional safety resources and important numbers readily available.&nbsp; Information specific to 1201 Third Avenue is provided on the <a href="/security/office-security-tips.aspx" title="Office Security Tips">Office Security Tips</a> and <a href="/your-safety/emergency-procedures.aspx" title="Emergency Procedures">Emergency Procedures</a> pages on this website.
