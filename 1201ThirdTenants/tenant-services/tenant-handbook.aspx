        <img src="/images/tenant_services.jpg" alt="Tenant Services" class="img-responsive pull-right pageImage">Wright Runstad &amp; Company has created a Tenant Handbook that outlines all of the building policies for Tenants’ use.&nbsp; Communication is the most crucial element in implementing the policies and procedures in the Tenant Handbook.&nbsp; To ensure effective communication, Wright Runstad &amp; Company requests each Tenant to designate a “Tenant representative” as the contact between your company and the Property Management office.&nbsp; Your representative will be responsible for understanding the policies and procedures outlined in the Tenant Handbook; for making requests or reporting problems to Property Management; and for conveying to your staff any important notices or information issued by the Property Management office.
